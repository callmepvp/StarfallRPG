Currently working on optimising skill commands.

ONLY WORKING ON SCAVENGING RIGHT NOW! (don't touch any other skill commands in this branch)


Scavenging Command ->
Has to update: Inventory values, essence value, collection value, skill values
Has to search for: suitable items based on users tier of tool (How to do that?)

Player properties to consider: tier of tool, player area

File with all items sorted by location and then tool type?
