# Welcome to Alphaworks!
The world is a dark and mysterious place. You've woken up in the middle of nowhere and you remember only fragments of what lead you here. Is this your demise or will it be the start of something new?
Explore vast biomes and areas, hold legendary battles with the undead, craft and tinker, scavenge and forage the forests, build and rule - do everything in your power to prepare yourself!

Before you are able to use any commands, you must setup your account with `/register`.
*(Read through all the rules very carefully!)*

Your main arsenal of action commands include X skill commands: `/forage`, `/mine`, `/fish`, `/scavenge`, `/farm`
